# Welke gemeenten doen mee? (Which Dutch municipalities are participating?)

This app helps you to keep record of which Dutch municipalities are participating in a project that you run. You see on a map and in a table if they:
- do participate ('ja')
- are interested in participating ('belangstelling')
- don't want to participate ('nee')
- have not yet been asked what they want ('onbekend')

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Angular
The app is made with Angular 5. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.
